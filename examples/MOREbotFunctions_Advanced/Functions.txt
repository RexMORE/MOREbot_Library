Adds MOREbot Library to program
#include “MOREbot.h”

Two motor MOREbot constructor. Creates left and right motor objects to control the motors.
	MOREbot(int LM, int RM);
ie: MOREbot robot(1, 2);
	
Two motor and ultrasonic MOREbot constructor. Creates left and right motor objects to control the motors and an ultrasonic object to sense distance. 
	MOREbot(int LM, int RM, int trig, int echo); 
ie: MOREbot robot(1, 2, A0, A1);

Robot setup. Starts the motor shield i2c communication stream.
	void setup();

Drive the left motor clockwise (or counterclockwise with negative speeds) at speed between -100 and 100.
	void leftMotor(int speed);
	
Drive the right motor counterclockwise (or clockwise with negative speeds) at speed between -100 and 100.
	void rightMotor(int speed);

Distance sensing function. Calls ultasonic.readDistance() to get distance to the closest object in centimeters.
	float readDistance();
	
Drive function for MOREbot to drive forward. Commands the left motor clockwise and the right motor counterclockwise at the given speed.
	void forward(int speed);
	
Drive function for MOREbot to drive backward. Commands the left motor counterclockwise and the right motor clockwise at the given speed.
	void backward(int speed);
	
Drive function for MOREbot to drive left. Commands the both motors counterclockwise at the given speed.
	void left(int speed);

Drive function for MOREbot to drive right. Commands the both motors clockwise at the given speed.
	void right(int speed);
	
Drive function for MOREbot to stop. Commands the both motors to stop.
	void stop();
